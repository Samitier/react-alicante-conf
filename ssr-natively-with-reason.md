# SSR natively with Reason

Speaker: David Sancho

## What is ReasonML

Similar to OCaml, functional programming language.
Immutable, performant, statically strongly typed, practical FP (not dogmatic). Inferred typing.
Can compile to native, js, wasm, etc.
Good tooling. Comes with jsx built in

## Demo

He demoed some code with ReasonMl displaying its features.

## react reason server

He then presented a library he is developing to do SSR in ReasonML React.

**Opinion**: extremely niche use case. Not sure if I will ever find a use for this.
