# You are not becoming rich with a mobile app

Speaker: Stefano Solinas

## Intro

He talked about his process as an entrepreneur bringing to production his own projects.
He shared his defeats and victories.
He talked about how you can sacrifice morals to win money easier. And how much harder it is to make it if you want to do it the "correct" way.

## Imagzle

He talked about his best project, which went viral. He had millions of downloads, appeared in television, was the most downloaded app in Italy for a while and how it got eventually destroyed by other websites that posted the answers to its game.
He made no money out of it.

## Conclusions

He gave his personal insight on how frustrating the App competition might be for some and how his app, even if he could not made any money out of it, gave work to a team of people and inspired countless others.

**Opinion**: brutally honest retrospective of his career that honestly left me speechless. Really well constructed, engaging and with really deep topics. The speaker has a youtube channel that I will definitely check out (in italian): https://www.youtube.com/@obsidianart/videos
